# AnalyticaHouse-Case-Study

# a. Used tech-stack
I used BeautifulSoup4, requests, pandas and xlwt.

# b. A brief description of the challenges you face.
Reading metrics row by row from excel file made it a bit difficult for me. Also, some products have only one available size and html tag is different for these products. It was a bit hard to catch and fix this bug.

# c. What did you learn from this project?
How to read from excel file and write to excel file.

## d. Answers of the additional questions.

# 1. If I’d have 10000 urls that I should visit, then it takes hours to finish. What can we make to fasten this process?
I would split the urls and run the script for each divided part. For example, I would run the script for the first 5000 urls in first terminal and second 5000 urls in the second terminal. I would divide it as much as needed and run it that way.

# 2. Please briefly explain what is API and how it works.
An API is an information gateway that allows the back ends of software and services to communicate with one another. Data is typically stored in a database hosted on a physical server. To retrieve that data, you need to know how to talk to that database in order to get what you want. That’s how an API works: it helps by receiving requests and responding with the data needed to provide some functionality or service.
